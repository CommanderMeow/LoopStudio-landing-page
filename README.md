## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Sass




### What I learned

I have been trying to improve my Sass, including mixins which I am still new at using. I have also been trying to implement a more BEM inspired layout and naming convention which has made it easier to read and understand my code.



### Continued development

I will continue to focus on my layout and be more flexible on my BEM naming.
